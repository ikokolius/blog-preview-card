## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that it is best to set line-height using number, not percentages:

```css
.line-height: 1.5;
.line-height: 150%; /* gives unpredictable results due to rounding */
```

### Continued development

I haven't still figured out how to set different font sizes for desktop and mobile versions withour media queries
